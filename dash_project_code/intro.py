###### Users can choose visulization moduel to find which county has the largest amount of cancer cases and where power plants and NPL sites are.

###### Modeling moduel is used to show some advanced statistical methodology to do classifiication. 

###### In the modeling section, counties are splitted into three categories based on cancer rate: low, medium, and high.
